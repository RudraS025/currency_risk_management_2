# üìñ HOW TO MAKE AI REMEMBER THIS BOOKMARK

## üéØ Context Restoration Methods

### **Method 1: Reference the Bookmark Files (Recommended)**
When starting a new conversation, simply mention or attach these key files:
- `VERSION_BOOKMARK.md` - Complete version documentation
- `BOOKMARK_SUMMARY.md` - Quick reference summary
- `TECHNOLOGY_STACK_PRESENTATION.html` - Technology overview

**Example prompt:**
```
"I'm working on the currency risk management system. Please review the VERSION_BOOKMARK.md file to understand the current production baseline v1.0.0-production-ready."
```

### **Method 2: Git Tag Reference**
Mention the specific git tag to help me locate the exact version:
```
"I need to work with the currency risk management system, specifically the v1.0.0-production-ready tagged version."
```

### **Method 3: Quick Context Summary**
Provide a brief summary of what you need:
```
"I have a production-ready currency risk management system (v1.0.0-production-ready) built with Next.js/React/TypeScript. It includes live FX rates, cubic spline interpolation, and proprietary P&L methodology. I need to continue development from this baseline."
```

### **Method 4: File Structure Reference**
Point to the project structure:
```
"I'm working in d:\CURRENCY_RISK_MANAGEMENT_2025\currency-risk-management - this is a production-ready currency risk management system with all features implemented."
```

## üîç Key Information to Always Include

## üìã Template Prompts for Future Use

### **For General Development:**
```
"I'm continuing work on my currency risk management system. The production baseline is tagged as v1.0.0-production-ready. Please check the VERSION_BOOKMARK.md file for the complete feature list and technology stack."
```

### **For Bug Fixes:**
```
"I have an issue with my currency risk management system (v1.0.0-production-ready). The system includes live FX rates, cubic spline interpolation, and P&L calculations. Please review the current codebase and help fix [specific issue]."
```

### **For New Features:**
```
"I want to add [new feature] to my production-ready currency risk management system. The baseline is v1.0.0-production-ready with all core features implemented. Please maintain compatibility with the existing P&L methodology."
```

### **For Client Presentations:**
```
"I need to prepare for a client presentation using my currency risk management system (v1.0.0-production-ready). Please review the TECHNOLOGY_STACK_PRESENTATION.html and help me prepare [specific presentation needs]."
```

## üé≤ Fallback Strategies

### **If Files Are Missing:**
1. **Repository Structure**: Mention the project is in `d:\CURRENCY_RISK_MANAGEMENT_2025\currency-risk-management`
2. **Technology Stack**: Next.js 15.3.5, React 19.0.0, TypeScript 5.x
3. **Core Features**: Live FX rates, cubic spline, P&L methodology
4. **Git Tag**: `v1.0.0-production-ready`

### **If Starting Fresh:**
```
"I have a currency risk management system that was previously developed to production-ready status. It includes live market data, Interest Rate Parity calculations, cubic spline interpolation, and a proprietary P&L methodology. The system is built with Next.js/React/TypeScript and was tagged as v1.0.0-production-ready on July 8, 2025."
```

## üîÑ Best Practices
