## 🧪 Persistence Fix Testing Protocol

### **Phase 1: Initial Data Load**
1. ✅ Open application at http://localhost:3004
2. ✅ Verify Demo Contracts appear automatically (first visit only)
3. ✅ Check Data Management tab is visible
4. ✅ Verify current data status shows:
   - Contracts count
   - Currency pairs count
   - Interest rates count
   - Last updated timestamp

### **Phase 2: Contract Creation & Persistence**
1. 🔧 **Create New Contract Test:**
   - Go to Contract Management tab
   - Create a new Export/Import contract
   - Fill in all required fields
   - Submit the contract
   - ✅ Verify contract appears in the list immediately

2. 🔧 **Persistence Test:**
   - Refresh the page (F5)
   - ✅ Verify your new contract is still there
   - ✅ Verify contract data is complete and accurate

### **Phase 3: Demo Contract Management**
1. 🔧 **Demo Contract Control:**
   - Go to Data Management tab
   - Click "Clear Contracts" to remove all contracts
   - Refresh the page (F5)
   - ✅ Verify NO demo contracts reappear (smart loading)
   - Click "Load Demo Contracts"
   - ✅ Verify demo contracts are loaded

### **Phase 4: Data Export & Clear Functions**
1. 🔧 **Export Function:**
   - Click "Export Data" button
   - ✅ Verify JSON file downloads successfully
   - ✅ Open file and verify it contains contracts data

2. 🔧 **Clear Functions:**
   - Test "Clear Contracts" (removes contracts only)
   - Test "Reset All Data" (clears localStorage completely)
   - ✅ Verify appropriate confirmation dialogs appear

### **Phase 5: P&L Analytics Persistence**
1. 🔧 **Create contracts with different dates**
2. 🔧 **Go to P&L Analytics tab**
3. 🔧 **Generate P&L reports**
4. 🔧 **Refresh page and verify data persists**

### **Phase 6: Live Data Integration**
1. 🔧 **Currency Rates:**
   - ✅ Verify live FX rates are loading
   - ✅ Check rates are realistic (USD/EUR ~0.85, USD/INR ~84, etc.)

2. 🔧 **Interest Rates:**
   - ✅ Verify central bank rates are loading
   - ✅ Check rates are accurate (RBI: 5.50%, Fed: ~5.25%, etc.)

## 🎯 Expected Results

### **✅ FIXED Issues:**
- ✅ Contracts persist across page refreshes
- ✅ No infinite demo contract loading
- ✅ Unique contract IDs prevent duplicates
- ✅ Smart demo loading (only on first visit)
- ✅ Data Management controls work correctly
- ✅ localStorage properly saves and loads data

### **🚀 Features Working:**
- ✅ Live FX rate integration
- ✅ Central bank interest rates
- ✅ Forward rate calculations (IRP)
- ✅ P&L analytics and MTM
- ✅ Contract management (Export/Import/Forward)
- ✅ Data export functionality
- ✅ Responsive UI design

## 🐛 If You Find Issues:

### **Contracts Not Persisting:**
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Application > Local Storage
3. Check if `currencyRiskManagement` key exists
4. Verify data is being saved

### **Demo Contracts Keep Reappearing:**
1. Check localStorage for `demoContractsLoaded` flag
2. Clear localStorage completely and test again

### **Performance Issues:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify live API calls are not failing
3. Check network tab for slow requests

## 📞 Support Notes:

**All persistence issues have been addressed in the code:**
- `CurrencyContext.tsx` - localStorage integration
- `DataManagement.tsx` - data control interface
- `ContractManagement.tsx` - contract creation with persistence
- `PnLAnalytics.tsx` - analytics with data persistence

**Next Steps After Testing:**
1. Complete local testing checklist
2. Fix any remaining issues
3. Optional: Deploy to Heroku
4. Optional: Implement multi-tenancy features
5. Optional: Add additional reporting features
